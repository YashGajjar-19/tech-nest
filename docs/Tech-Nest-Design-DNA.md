## 🎨 1. Color System
Premium brands use fewer colors. Tech Nest relies heavily on deep graphite and intelligent blue.

**Primary Colors:**
- **Background (Deep Graphite):** `#000000` - Pure black; feels like Linear. 
- **Surface (Soft Graphite):** `#0A0A0A` - Cards & sections.
- **Signature Accent (Intelligent Blue):** `#4F9CF9` - Identity color. Represents trust, intelligence, neutrality, global tech.

**Functional Colors:**
- **Decision Green:** `#22C55E` - Recommended, Best choice, Positive signals.
- **Reality Amber:** `#F59E0B` - Warnings & tradeoffs.
- *Rule:* Avoid harsh reds. Calm authority, not news drama.

## 🔤 2. Typography System
Your biggest branding weapon.

- **Primary Font (Headings):** Satoshi (or Inter Tight) - modern like Linear, premium like Apple, techy but human.
- **Body Font (Reading):** Inter - Highly readable. Trust increases with readability.
- **Technical / Specs Font:** Geist Mono or JetBrains Mono - Used for chipsets, RAM, benchmarks, specs. Creates subtle tech authority.
